# Python Behave Example Project

This project demonstrates how to use Python Behave, a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework, to write and execute functional tests. 
The tests are designed to interact with the Saucedemo website, a sample e-commerce platform, to validate key functionalities such as login, navigation, and product interactions.
